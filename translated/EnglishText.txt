Mairwyn speaks to the winds, which whisper for change, chaos, and destruction. However, she seems content to only massacre those who wander too close to her Grove.|Armoured Skeleton|Poacher|Bomber|Clive the Firestarter|An unparalleled genius in the explosive arts. Unfortunately for Grayson, this chaotic psychopath is far too useful to get rid of at providing and mixing destructive materials. He’ll burn down his entire camp just to take you with him, laughing all the while.|Deadeye|Lidia the Chaos Archer|An adept but undisciplined archer, she lets her arrows fly and trusts that fate knows where to take them, and it works. Lidia is a force of chaos that cannot be contained, and the bandit king is happy to let her do as she likes as long as it benefits him.|Keely the Frost Archer|A cold-hearted bandit lieutenant, she oversees the animal husbandry and leather tanning camp in Farbane. Once a member of the Dunley militia, she was removed from her position for her brutal battlefield decision-making. Aside from being a crack shot, her enchanted arrows rain down icy death.|Rufus the Foreman|A lieutenant of the bandit forces charged with looking over the logging camp. Just because he’s an expert woodworker doesn’t mean he doesn’t know his way around a crossbow, though. He didn’t rise up in the bandit ranks for nothing.|Boris the Gravedigger|Quincey the Marauder|Grim|Errol the Stonebreaker|A brutal mining foreman, just as adept at crushing stone as he is crushing bone. Not even his incredible eye for recovering and refining metals was enough to stop him from getting run out of civilised society. His violent rage makes a fine motivator for the miners.|Mugger|Percy the Pacifist|Stalker|Thief|Thug|Quincey the Bandit King|The ‘King’ of the bandits, once heralded as a hero of the common people in Dunley. His lack of proper reverence for the Church of Luminance saw him driven into Farbane, where his prowess in battle earned the respect of the banditry and, eventually, a place as their champion and king. He may have been a good man, once.|Trapper|Bandit Wolf|Unit that yields <teal1>Spectral Dust</c>, chance for <teal1>Scourgestone</c> and <teal1>Grave Dust</c>.|Nightmarshal Styx the Sunderer|A legendary vampire from the age of Dracula. He was one of only a handful of loyalists bold enough to be well beyond enemy lines when the barrier of darkness was erected over Farbane. Thinking himself abandoned by his allies to the forces of humanity, he has not since forgotten this betrayal.|Bear|Bell Ringer|Goreswine the Ravager|A mad cultist, too far gone to be really intelligible. The malevolent being they serve pushes them to desecrate all things, with little regard for practicality. They wear a rotting pig’s head as a decorative mask.|Leandra the Shadow Priestess|There are few creatures on the face of Vardoran as ancient as Leandra. Some say whatever dark power she acts as a conduit for simply refuses to let her pass into death. Some whispers, quieter and less daring, suggest she was once one of Dracula’s most trusted advisors.|Shadow Soldier|Blacksmith|Blacksmith Servant|A blacksmith defends your castle against intruders and unlocks new recipes on the Anvil and the Furnace. You only need one blacksmith in your castle.|Blood Maggot|Cardinal Aide|Cleric|Copper Golem|Corpse Pile|Cow|Slicer|Flame Fanatic|Cursed Bear|Gorecrusher the Behemoth|Once a fiercely loyal warrior in Dracula’s army. It’s said he went mad after the vampire lord’s defeat, amputating his sword arm in shame for his failure to protect his master. In a haze from blood loss, he wandered into the wilderness to die. The corruption of the Cursed Forest gave him not death, but something much worse.|Gorecrusher Spirit|Cursed Treant|Cursed Wolf|Deer|Demon Spawn|Unit that yields <teal1>Demon Fragments</c>.|Ferocious Bear|This mother bear is said to be ancient. Rumour has it that she wears a scar from every Bandit King that has ever lived, a rite of passage for the position. Her life stands as testament to the fact that no bandit leader has ever done well enough to finish the job.|Putrid Rat|Farmers try to be diligent in keeping their pest problems under control, as legend says that any place too infested might find themselves visited by the Putrid Rat. No one is quite sure how it gets in, but they know it by the stench of rotting flesh and its carnivorous appetite.|A giant deadly putrid rat. The blood of this rat could be useful...|Divine Angel|Enchanted Cross|Fallen Angel|Farmer|Christina the Sun Priestess|A faithful servant of the Church of Luminance with a mean streak, Christina serves as both a den mother to acolytes as well as a stern disciplinarian. Every young priest or nun knows not to cross her.|Feral Ghoul|Footman|Vincent the Frostbringer|A stalwart champion of law and order in Dunley, it’s his mission to protect the common people with his chilling gifts. Some say his methods have been getting more harsh and violent ever since his sister was banished.|Terah the Geomancer|The result of a long line of earth speakers, Terah resides up in the solitude of the mountains among sparkling gem veins and rugged boulders. Despite her stoic appearance and demeanour, communing with the spirits of nature has driven her quite insane.|Ghoul|Unit that yields <teal1>Bones</c>, chance for <teal1>Grave Dust</c>.|Giant Rat|Unit that yields <teal1>Animal Hides</c>, chance for low grade <teal1>Seeds</c>|Harpy|Morian the Stormwing Matriarch|The most dangerous of her kind, and fiercely protective of her tribe. It’s said that the harpies are attracted to only the finest gemstones, and none has a sharper eye for quality than the matriarch herself. Wealthy folk are warned to keep their jewels out of sight if they dare travel outside the protection of Brighthaven.|Harpy Dasher|Harpy Scratcher|Harpy Sorceress|Horse|Brutus the Watcher|Boyo|Iron Golem|Knight|Lightweaver|Lumberjack|Lumberjack Servant|The Winged Horror|A creature that was once one of Dracula’s favourite pets. The monster mourned the death of its master in a blood-soaked vigil, enduring the toxic, bloody rains that followed Dracula’s death for seven days and seven nights. This is the mangled monstrosity that emerged.|Mantrap|Plant Mother|Guard|Raziel the Shepherd|The head and heart of the Dunley Monastery and a true believer in the Light, Raziel is known for his persuasive sermons and harsh, fire-and-brimstone rhetoric. It is believed that his holy power is granted by his incredible righteousness, largely because he keeps saying so.|Bomb Thrower|Militia Crossbow|Devoted|Militia Brawler|Hound|Octavian the Militia Captain|An old soldier and a veteran of many battles, Octavian is perhaps the most trusted man in all of Dunley. The militia serves him without question, and he in turn serves them to the best of his ability. Don’t let his age fool you, he’s got plenty of fight left in him.|Militia Light|Militia Longbow|Meredith the Bright Archer|Meredith is a true believer in the Church of Luminance, and believes that her power, a gift from the Light, she has a responsibility to wield against dark forces. As brave as she is naive, she is so unafraid to stare into the light that it blinds her. She knows only the pursuit of justice at any cost.|Monk|Torchbearer|Miner|Cursed Slime Toad|The Duke of Balaton|The patriarch of a family that once held land when these swamps were adequately inhabited. Over time, the cursed land twisted them, leaving this horrible, twisted toad that only remembers its lust for gold and jewels. It jealously guards its hoard of forgotten, worthless currency.|Cursed Spitter Toad|Moose|Rabid Albino Moose|Mosquito|Unit that yields <teal1>Scales</c>, spawns with a random blood type.|Night Lurker|Nun|Paladin|Solarus the Immaculate|A legendary paladin of the Light, and the oldest living member of the Church of Luminance. His connection to the Light has extended his lifetime seemingly indefinitely, and he’s watched the steady descent of man down the path of comfort, greed, and avarice with disinterest. A pioneer of the age of heroes, he yearns for the days of glory to return and cares for little else.|Pig|Priest|Ram|Rat|Rifleman|Rotting Ghoul|Scarecrow|Sheep|Skeleton|Skeleton Crossbow|Banshee|Skeleton Bishop|Unit that yields <teal1>Bone</c>.|Undead Commander|Skeleton Mage|Konrad the Mad|Skeleton Priest|Unit that yields <teal1>Bones</c>, chance for <teal1>Scourgestone</c> and <teal1>Grave Dust</c>.|Unstable Spider|Ungora the Spider Queen|A massive spider of legendary age and progeny. The Spider Queen resides in the twisted, web-woven depths of Cursed Forest’s winding caverns. No living creature save for her children has ever entered and lived to tell the tale.|Broodmother|Spiderling|Unit that yields <teal1>Silk Worm</c>.|Crawler|Weaver|Grayson the Armourer|The working arm and logistical mastermind of the bandit forces, Grayson is the backbone of their operation. As the quartermaster of a band of chaotic outlaws, murderers, and thieves, he’s the stern voice of reason that keeps their gang well fed and well equipped.|Stone Colossus|Stone Golem|Beatrice the Tailor|The most talented tailor in all of Vardoran, but no one is without a skeleton in their closet. Though the legacy of Dracula’s blood runs through her veins, she has proven far more charming than dangerous.|Tailor Servant|Azariel the Sunbringer|A true politician, Azariel wormed his way to the top of the ranks of the Church of Luminance with cold, calculated social grace. Few can match his power and dedication to the Light short of Solarus the Immaculate himself, and none within the church would dare contradict his word.|Gavyn the Shady Dealer|Berk the Travelling Trader|Ottar the Merchant|Treant|Nicholaus the Fallen|A necromancer driven out of high society in Silverlight for his indulgence in the dark arts. Now he lives among the undead, using his unliving servants to fulfil his needs, as well as bring him back unwilling subjects for his experiments.|Heart of Nicholaus|Undying Ghoul|Tristan the Vampire Hunter|A cold-blooded killer, and the scion of a long line of vampire hunters. Few are as prepared to face the rising tide of the vampire threat as Tristan, and his drive to exterminate the last of the unholy threat is second to none.|Villager|Frostmaw the Mountain Terror|An unspeakable horror that lurks in the snowy corridors of the Hallowed Mountains. Some say it used to be a simple woodsman. Most don’t dare invoke its name at all.|Werewolf|Willfred the Werewolf Chief|None of the werewolves asked for this curse, but what makes Willfred dangerous is that he embraces it. He is the chief of the werewolf village not just for his ferocity, but the way he embodies the carnivorous terror of his twisted little village.|Willfred the Village Elder|Polora the Feywalker|A powerful psychopomp that taps into mysterious spiritual sources. Polora is one of the only known mortal links to fairy kind and driven to the brink of sanity by her intimate connection to nature. Her dream-like home is alive with unique, enchanted plant life.|Pixie|Arctic Bear|Terrorclaw the Ogre|A creature whose story has long since been lost to the ages, though not without resemblance to some few legendary creatures that were once men. One cannot help but wonder what strange corruption has taken root in Vardoran.|Frost Wolf|Witch|Matka the Curse Weaver|Some say Matka is the oldest of the witches, but the truth is that nobody knows how or when these timeless creatures were born. A force of nature and a mockery of humanity, she is utterly beyond reason.|Withered Vampire|Wolf|Alpha Wolf|A ferocious apex predator of its kind, many times larger, stronger, and more hostile than its smaller kin. The Alpha Wolf, true to its name, is regarded by others of its kind with absolute authority. They never truly hunt alone.|Woodcutter|Worm Terror|Foulrot the Soultaker|A mad cultist that claims to be the vessel of his decapitated horse, ‘Foulrot the Soultaker.’ He also claims his blades take their victims straight to hell, an effort to feed or please some infernal power.
